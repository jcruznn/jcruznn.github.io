                <strong>Joel Cruz</strong> Joel Cruz is a designer and maker whose work explores the intersections of craft, technology, video, and material experimentation. Drawing from a background in communication and a deep appreciation for fashion as both art and function, Cruz creates garments that merge traditional techniques with innovative processes. His practice spans from digital fabrication to handwork, demonstrating a commitment to both precision and tactility.
In Printed Couture, Cruz reimagined lace through generative design and 3D printing, integrating code-based patterns directly into a wearable dress. Inspired by designers like Iris van Herpen, Schiaparelli, and Philip Beesley, the project reflects his interest in translating digital structures into physical, flexible textiles.
In Woven Gradients, he turned to crochet to explore color transitions, texture, and the meditative rhythm of stitch-making. The project includes a grey ombré bolero and a reworked brown sweater, each highlighting the individuality and intimacy of handmade garments.
Across both projects, Cruz’s work celebrates the merging of old and new, blending algorithmic design with handcraft, high-tech precision with the irregular beauty of human touch. His designs are guided by curiosity, iteration, and a belief that fashion can serve as a bridge between tradition and the future.
